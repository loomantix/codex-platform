# codex-platform — Agent Guide

Upstream source of truth for Loomantix Codex skills, reusable agent workflows, and repo-sync automation. Apache 2.0 + DCO.

## Repository Policy

This repo is public-facing. Keep all issues, PRs, comments, and docs suitable for public readers:

- Do not reference private consumer repositories by name.
- Do not document private fleet topology, internal escalation paths, or deployment-specific secret names.
- Keep compliance rationale generic; do not describe private audit findings or control mappings.
- Put consumer-specific details in the consumer repo, not here.

## Working Rules

- Preserve the agent-agnostic sync engine unless a Codex feature genuinely requires a schema change.
- Do not do implementation work directly on `main`; create a topic branch and PR back to `main`.
- Put Codex-discoverable workflows under `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Keep large or optional role prompts under `.codex/references/` and have skills load them only when needed.
- Consumer-editable files should use `create_if_missing: true` in `scripts/sync-targets.yml`.
- Files listed in `scripts/sync-targets.yml` are upstream-owned; consumer edits will be overwritten unless the target is skipped.

## Review Workflow

See [`.codex/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`](.codex/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md) for the canonical lean/deep review chain.
