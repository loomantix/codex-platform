# Install the upstream Codex skills into the user's global skills
# directory by symlinking. Updates then flow via `git pull` in this checkout
# rather than per-repo sync PRs — no install-skills re-run needed unless new
# skills are added.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/install-skills.sh           # safe: only install missing skills
#   ./scripts/install-skills.sh --force   # replace existing entries (backed up)
#   ./scripts/install-skills.sh --dry-run # report what would happen, write nothing
#
# Re-run after `git pull` in this repo only if you see "would install" output
# for a new skill — existing symlinks pick up upstream edits automatically.
#
# Source root override: by default the script uses the parent of its own
# directory (so `clone-root/scripts/install-skills.sh` finds skills at
# `clone-root/.codex/skills`). Set `UPSTREAM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` to point at a
# different checkout — useful when this script has been copied or vendored
# into a consumer that wants to install skills from a sibling clone.
