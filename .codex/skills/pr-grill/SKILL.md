description: Cross-engine deep review of an existing PR. Run when you want a second engine's deep adversarial pass on a PR another engine (or you) already opened — typically after the authoring engine's own grill/reviewit. Runs the deep review matrix on the PR diff, applies fixes, and pushes them back to the PR head branch so the originating engine can re-review.

# PR Grill — cross-engine relay review

Run the deep review matrix against an **already-open PR** as a different engine
from the one that authored it, fix what you find, and push the fixes back so the
originating engine can re-review. The value is engine diversity: a second model
catches design-level blind spots the authoring engine baked in and would not
question on its own. The hand-back is the point — `pr-grill` is one leg of a
round trip, not a terminal review.

This is **not** `deepgrill`. `deepgrill` reviews local pre-push work, runs
`refactorpass`, and refuses to push. `pr-grill` targets an existing PR diff,
skips `refactorpass` (do not churn a PR under cross-review), and pushes signed
fix commits back to the PR head branch. It reuses `grill`'s deep matrix by
reference — load the same role prompts, do not restate them here.

## Safety preconditions — verify before doing anything

1. **Own-branch only.** This skill pushes. Refuse to run if the checked-out
   branch is `main`, `master`, or `staging`, or is the PR's **base** branch.
   You may only push to the PR's **head** branch.
2. **Confirm the head branch is the current branch and tracks a remote.** If the
   working tree is not on the PR head (e.g. the PR was not fetched into this
   worktree), stop and print the fetch recipe in Phase 0 rather than guessing.
3. **Never force-push.** A plain push only. If the push is rejected because the
   remote head moved, stop and report — do not `--force`.
4. **Never bypass commit signing.** Commit with the repo's normal signing
   config. Do not pass `--no-gpg-sign` or disable `commit.gpgsign`.

## Phase 0: Resolve the PR target

Take the PR number from the invocation (`pr-grill <pr-number>`).

If the PR is not already checked out in this worktree, stop and tell the user to
fetch it in isolation (do not switch branches in a shared checkout):

```bash
git fetch origin <base>                       # the PR's base branch, kept fresh
git fetch origin pull/<pr-number>/head:pr-<pr-number>
git worktree add ../review-pr-<pr-number> pr-<pr-number>
cd ../review-pr-<pr-number>
# re-run pr-grill <pr-number> here
```

Determine the review scope as the PR's net diff:

```bash
BASE=$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)   # always read from the PR — some repos use a non-default base such as staging
git fetch -q origin "$BASE"
RANGE="$(git merge-base "origin/$BASE" HEAD)..HEAD"
```

Skip docs/config-only changesets (same heuristic as `grill`): if `git diff
--name-only "$RANGE"` contains no source files, report the skip and exit — there
is nothing for the matrix to find.

## Phase 1: Deep matrix on the PR diff

Run `grill`'s **deep** matrix against `$RANGE`: the six core lanes plus the
conditional tenant-coupling lane when customer-variable behavior is present. Load the lane prompts
from `grill`'s role references — do not re-author them:

- `.codex/references/roles/code-reviewer.md`
- `.codex/references/roles/silent-failure-hunter.md`
- `.codex/references/roles/type-design-analyzer.md`
- `.codex/references/roles/comment-analyzer.md`
- `.codex/references/roles/pr-test-analyzer.md`
- `.codex/references/roles/security-reviewer.md`

Run the lanes as independently as the active runtime permits; if subagents are
unavailable, run separate local passes and disclose the downgrade under `review
depth` in the output. Keep lane findings separate until all lanes complete, then
deduplicate by root cause.

Invoking `pr-grill` is an explicit request to use independent subagents for the
six core review lanes, plus the conditional tenant-coupling lane when signaled,
whenever the active runtime exposes subagent/delegation tools. Do not require the
user to separately say "use subagents" before spawning those lane reviewers.

**Cross-engine emphasis.** You are reviewing another engine's work. Beyond
line-level bugs, scrutinize the _design decisions_ the author made and did not
question: chosen abstractions, latency/UX tradeoffs, removed or added special
cases, and whether a "fix" traded away a property the original code protected.
These are the findings a same-engine grill misses and the reason this pass
exists.

## Phase 2: Apply fixes

Apply `grill`'s fix bias to `$RANGE`: fix every valid finding, including nits.
Dismiss invalid findings or suggestions that would make the code worse, with the
evidence that disproves them. Defer only valid but extremely large follow-ups
(roughly 300+ lines or cross-cutting rewrites) and open or link a GitHub issue
for each deferral. Critical correctness/security findings must not be silently
dropped. Run the smallest relevant formatter/test command the repo documents for
the files you touched.

## Phase 3: Commit and push (automatic)

If fixes were applied, commit and push without a confirmation gate — this skill
is for your own PR branches.

1. **Label the relay commit** so the cross-engine leg is auditable in `git log`:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix(pr-grill): <one-line summary of what the cross-engine pass changed>" \
     --trailer "Cross-engine-review: pr-grill"
   ```

   Use the repo's normal signing config (do not disable it).

2. **Push to the PR head branch** (plain push, no force):

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   If the push is rejected, stop and report the rejection — do not force-push or
   rebase silently.

If no fixes were applied (clean, or everything deferred/dismissed), do not
commit or push. Report the clean result.

## Phase 4: Hand back

Print a summary aimed at the **originating engine's re-review** — it needs to
know what changed and what to scrutinize:

```text
pr-grill complete on PR #<pr-number> (cross-engine pass).
review depth: <deep with independent subagents | deep local multi-pass fallback>
findings fixed:    <count + one-line each>
design tradeoffs flagged: <any decisions the re-review should adjudicate — e.g. a fix
                           that simplified logic but changed a latency/UX property>
deferred / dismissed: <count + rationale>
validation run:    <commands + result>
pushed:            <yes: SHA on <head-branch> | no fixes — nothing pushed>

Hand back to the authoring engine for re-review of the new HEAD
(e.g. `reviewit <pr-number>` or a fresh `grill` on the pushed commit).
```

Always surface the design tradeoffs explicitly — the round trip only works if
the engine reviewing next knows where to look.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not run `refactorpass`.** No cleanup-churn on a PR under cross-review.
- **Does not open or merge the PR**, and does not push to a base branch.
- **Does not force-push or rebase.** A rejected push is reported, not forced.
- **Does not replace `reviewit`.** Bot review (Gemini + Copilot) is a separate
  post-push concern; `pr-grill` is the local cross-engine deep pass.
